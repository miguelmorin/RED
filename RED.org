* Figure 1

Figure 1 shows that payroll employment is slower to recover after the last three recessions, for a given recovery of output of 5%. I use data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) with the series GDPC1 (real GDP, "C" for chained) and PAYEMS (payroll employment), unfiltered. The recovery of employment is $100 \log(L_\tau'/ L_ \tau)$, between the quarter of the NBER trough $\tau$ and the time $\tau'$ such that output recovers by 5% $(\log(Y_\tau'/ Y_\tau) = \log(1 + 5\%)$, with linear interpolation on the log of employment before converting back to percentages. The interpretation of this Figure is close to the percentage of recovery of employment by the time that output recovers by 5%, if observed in continuous time
.

The original figure was:

I updated this figure with code in Julia. Each function has doc-tests, which provide assurance that the code is doing the right thing. I also added the estimate of the average of the recovery of employment for the last three recessions and for the previous 7 recessions, along with 95% confidence intervals (from a linear regression of the recovery of employment on a constant). These bands clearly show that the two averages are statistically different. The series GDPC1 is the default measure of economic activity and omitted in the function calls.

The Current Population Survey is another measure of employment (FRED series CE160V). It has diverged significantly from the payroll employment numbers in recent decades. This figure plots the recovery of employment from the Current Population Survey. Notice the drop in the average, although the pattern is less clear.

One referee from the AEJ Macro asked about female labor force participation: "As this theory is a theory about the trend, it would be nice if the author provided some justification for why this trend (the trend decline in the price of computers) is more relevant for the overall level of employment than the (recent) slowdown in the trend of female labor force participation. (Albanasi and Sahin 2014)" I still see this question as coming from left field, but it is interesting to produce these pictures again with a split by men and women (series LNS12000001 and LNS12000002). The employment figures for these come from the Current Population Survey. I find no significant difference between men and women (if anything, the pattern is stronger for men than for women):
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 men", emp_symbol = :LNS12000001)
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 women", emp_symbol = :LNS12000002)

The results at the monthly frequency are similar to the quarterly frequency. Here I use Industrial production as a monthly indicator of economic activity and employment in the goods-producing sector as the corresponding measure of employment.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 monthly", gdp_symbol = :INDPRO, emp_symbol = :USGOOD)
#+END_SRC

This next picture uses Hours of nonfarm workers, which start only in 1965. With hours, 2007 has a strong recovery, which breaks the statistical difference between the means:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 hours", emp_symbol = :TOTLQ)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This next picture uses the civilian employment ratio (employment divided by labor force). Because this measure is a ratio, I do not transform the logarithm and use just the change, measured in percentage points.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 employment rate", emp_symbol = :EMRATIO)
#+END_SRC

The results for blacks and African American employment rate are similar:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 blacks", emp_symbol = :LNS12300006)
#+END_SRC

[[file:/Users/mmorin/RED/results/figure1 blacks.png]]

The next figures show the employment rate for the Hispanic and Latino group, Black and African American men over 20 years of age, and Black and African American women over 20 years of age. Here, the recent recessions have a lower average, though it's not statistically signficantly different from the previous two recessions, possibly because the sample size is limited to 5 recessions instead of the 10 post-war recessions (aside from the 1980 recession, whose recovery was too short because of the 1981 recession):

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 hispanic", emp_symbol = :LNS12300009)
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 black men", emp_symbol = :LNS12300031)
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 black women", emp_symbol = :LNS12300032)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: "results/figure1 hispanic.png"
: "results/figure1 black men.png"
: "results/figure1 black women.png"

[[file:/Users/mmorin/RED/results/figure1 hispanic.png]]

[[file:/Users/mmorin/RED/results/figure1 black men.png]]
[[file:/Users/mmorin/RED/results/figure1 black women.png]]

Hispanic and Latino have series by men and women (FRED series LNU02300034 and LNU02300035), but these start only in January 2000, which gives no comparison to previous recessions.

Information by sector, such as the [[https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2017][NAICS sectoral classification]], has little information. For example, monthly employment in finance and insurance starts in January 1990. I will focus on employment by routine occupation later in this document.


* Figure 2

The price of computers has fallen substantially since 1960. This figure plots a price index for computers in a log scale. The data comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis through [[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B935RG3Q086SBEA][FRED]].
