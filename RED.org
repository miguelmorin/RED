* Figure 1

Figure 1 shows that payroll employment is slower to recover after the last three recessions, for a given recovery of output of 5%. I use data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) with the series GDPC1 (real GDP, "C" for chained) and PAYEMS (payroll employment), unfiltered. The recovery of employment is $100 \log(L_\tau'/ L_ \tau)$, between the quarter of the NBER trough $\tau$ and the time $\tau'$ such that output recovers by 5% $(\log(Y_\tau'/ Y_\tau) = \log(1 + 5\%)$, with linear interpolation on the log of employment before converting back to percentages. The interpretation of this Figure is close to the percentage of recovery of employment by the time that output recovers by 5%, if observed in continuous time
.

The original figure was:

I updated this figure with code in Julia. Each function has doc-tests, which provide assurance that the code is doing the right thing. I also added the estimate of the average of the recovery of employment for the last three recessions and for the previous 7 recessions, along with 95% confidence intervals (from a linear regression of the recovery of employment on a constant). These bands clearly show that the two averages are statistically different. The series GDPC1 is the default measure of economic activity and omitted in the function calls.

The Current Population Survey is another measure of employment (FRED series CE160V). It has diverged significantly from the payroll employment numbers in recent decades. This figure plots the recovery of employment from the Current Population Survey. Notice the drop in the average, although the pattern is less clear.

One referee from the AEJ Macro asked about female labor force participation: "As this theory is a theory about the trend, it would be nice if the author provided some justification for why this trend (the trend decline in the price of computers) is more relevant for the overall level of employment than the (recent) slowdown in the trend of female labor force participation. (Albanasi and Sahin 2014)" I still see this question as coming from left field, but it is interesting to produce these pictures again with a split by men and women (series LNS12000001 and LNS12000002). The employment figures for these come from the Current Population Survey. I find no significant difference between men and women:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :session :results output :tangle yes
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 men", emp_symbol = :LNS12000001)
  RED.Figure1(filepath = "results/figure1 women", emp_symbol = :LNS12000002)
#+END_SRC
